Write an algorithm that functions as a simple calculator. The program should ask
the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /, or %). Based on
the operator, perform the corresponding operation and print the result.

# Solution:
Num1 = int(input("Enter the First Number: "))
Num2 = int(input("Enter the Second Number: "))

ch = input("Enter the arithmetic operator: ")

if ch == '+':
    print(Num1 + Num2)

elif ch == '-':
    print(Num1 - Num2)

elif ch == '*':
    print(Num1 * Num2)

elif ch == '/':
    print(Num1 / Num2)

elif ch == '%':
    print(Num1 % Num2)
